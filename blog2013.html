		Here are three paintings which seem to be defining a new resultant
		vector amongst the scatter of my paintings over the last few months. In
		other words, a new direction maybe to lead me out of the sense of
		dispersion. It does not accord exactly with any of the groupings of
		attributes encompassed by that previous work, and yet it seems to flow
		from them, or some of them. And then there are new attributes to account
		for aswell.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I have to remember that this is happening partly because I reached a
		point where I could say definitively that some of the paintings I had
		done were too unsatisfying to show. What to do then? Why, paint them
		over, of course! the process of reconstructing those images is a very
		different one from the process of starting a new painting from scratch.
		Apart from anything else, I don't have to worry about what to start with
		&#x2013; its given. Then, wiping off some kind of drawing, or deconstructing
		it, or at least weakening it, in some way, is fascinating in itself. So
		the fact that some new ‘look' emerges in this process, is not
		surprising.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Its not that I haven't worked like this before. I have done so in the
		past (with a sense of satisfaction in it, as it happens) and I started
		out this very phase of my painting doing just that, painting over work
		from the last show I had at Watters. But then I got into the idea that I
		wanted to work on a blank canvas again, which I did with mixed success.
		I suppose there are so few limits in doing this that the decision-making
		is rather awesome, and each work can go off in so many different
		directions that it fairly drives me crazy. As always, I prefer having
		something given to me to work with (albeit given by ME!), so that there
		are restraints to work with and against.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I'm not sure these paintings are finished, but it is the very looseness
		of them that appeals to me, even though it is different kind of
		looseness than that which occurred when working solely with watered-down
		acrylics. This is oil painting &#x2013; fluffy and thin admittedly &#x2013; but it
		is BRUSHED and there is something quite disarming about that, and
		utterly different from the flows that happen when watery acrylic is
		blown across the canvas with a hair dryer.

		I wish I could worry less about the ‘success' of my paintings. By
		success, I really mean success in my own eyes, rather than success in a
		social sense. I think that success ‘in the world' can help to strengthen
		the sense of personal success and achievement, but it is not so much an
		end in itself.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Its very hard to even comprehend what personal success might mean.
		Harder still to measure it. The key to the first statement (‘I
		wish&#x2026;."), is that I wish I could WORRY less. I am not inclined to wish
		my paintings were better. I know that its almost impossible to judge
		that at all, so its rather meaningless to want them to be better. And
		yet that is exactly what my anxiety is about &#x2013; the anxiety is about the
		intangible, and unmeasurable, qualities of the work. So my rational
		response is to wish, not that they are better, but that I don't worry
		about it so much. There is a residual worry that if I get rid of the
		anxiety about their quality, the quality will actually deteriorate.
		Rationally, this doesn't stand up at all. Anxiety rarely leads to better
		outcomes. Nor is the absence of anxiety the same as self-satisfaction,
		or sloppiness or laziness. This is a fine point, and it turns on what
		are the real drivers of progress. It could be argued that progress
		happens just as effectively in the absence of fear and anxiety, or even
		more so. Anyway, noone would, in their right mind, choose to subject
		themselves to anxiety, just to get a good result. It is more a question
		of whether one tolerates the anxiety, and whether the question about it
		being a useful 'prod' to working effectively, is just an adjunct to that
		tolerance, rather than a useful tool in itself. Whether one chooses to
		tolerate anxiety also depends on what alternatives to that there may be.
		One needs effective tools to wipe out anxiety. If there were simple
		tools available to do this, then a lot of unhappiness would be banished
		from the world! its not a straightforward business. There are drugs, and
		then there are psychological strategies, such as cognitive behavioural
		therapy, meditation etc. And then there is always the possibility of
		developing one's own personal strategies. But this can be very
		difficult.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Those kinds of tools do not, in themselves, deal directly with what
		would seem, at least superficially, to be the object of the anxiety. In
		other words, they deal with the response of a person to their situation,
		rather than the situation itself. In my case, the issue of anxiety
		relates directly to my painting. But of course it is in my REACTION to
		that situation that the anxiety arises. The anxiety IS my reaction. I
		would like to change my perception of the paintings, rather than change
		something further down the chain of action.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Desire to paint
	      </p>

	      <p>
		&gt; activity of painting<br />
		&gt; paintings<br />
		&gt; perception of paintings<br />
		&gt; anxiety<br />
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Some would say that the anxiety IS the driver for doing more work,
		because this is a circle:
	      </p>


	      <div id="org5f0e9ae" class="figure">
		<p><img src="pics/blog/circle.png" alt="circle.png" />
		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		This is interesting, because it points to the issue of what does drive
		the work on. Perhaps its as simple as renaming anxiety in this circle.
		There are other ways of looking at the state of mind that leads to new
		activity, but it is likely to be a complex state, and one word may not
		describe it accurately. If I could define clearly what I would like to
		substitute for anxiety here, without losing the momentum of the circular
		activity, then I might be able to dispense with the negative aspects,
		and keep the positive ones (with subsequent progress as the circle
		continues to turn).
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Clearly, what is needed is a state that ‘sees' what would be a positive
		development from what exists (the current state of painting). Ideally,
		it senses that changes will lead to a more satisfying, or stimulating
		(or whatever it is that you want a painting to do to the viewer),
		result. It should see that something has already been achieved, which is
		a necessary stepping-stone to the next stage. This is already a more
		positive way of looking at what has been done, rather than seeing it in
		‘deficit' terms &#x2013; ie. what it fails to achieve. It takes all the work
		done so far, and somehow attempts to form a new trajectory from that. It
		is analytical in some senses, but necessarily intuitive, because the
		factors here can only partly be subjected to rational analysis.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Above all, it requires a close examination of the work in question, but
		in a context that does not generate anxiety. So exactly where, in all of
		this, does the anxiety come from? I think that it only really arises
		when the work is compared in some way with other areas of the field,
		outside of one's own practice. So it is a socially generated anxiety,
		perhaps a ‘status anxiety', as described by Alain de Botton. This is a
		huge problem in art, because everyone seems to need to contend that only
		their own practice is relevant, and by implication that all other
		practices are useless and irrelevant. It is almost the prime
		consideration in the presentation of artwork that what is being
		presented is not only the MOST significant work around, but that it is
		the ONLY work that matters. There are numerous ways in which the status
		of art is (often falsely) elevated by curatorial tricks. Its not so very
		different from any other kind of marketing, and it seems quite central
		to our capitalist economy. To think that one might be able to ignore,
		and be unaffected by, such forces, is naive.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		What strategies can I conjure up, then, to avoid this comparison with
		other work that is being actively promoted as superior, more relevant
		and altogether better than my own? The obvious first step would be to
		avoid looking at other people's work, especially in a gallery context.
		This approach is isolating, and not conducive to the idea that art
		progresses as a discourse, but it might be a good idea at times. When
		one is struggling with ones own direction, it does not necessarily help
		to look at how other people seem to be forging confidently ahead. ‘Seem'
		is the key word here, because there is a large amount of illusion and
		hype involved. The other strategy I could work on would be to hone my
		critical skills, in order to break through the illusions and see the
		other work for what it truly is, has truly achieved, which is often much
		less than is immediately apparent. But this is hard to do when you are
		feeling a tendency to anxiety anyhow. Why set yourself up to fail?
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Whether or not its a good idea to shut myself off from the outside world
		at these times, it does seem that the main focus should be on my own
		work. Though I think of myself as analytical (and Alberto says I think
		too much!), there is a lot that is left rather casually to my intuition,
		and its very easy for doubts and worries to creep in. It may be that I
		will have to write out these thoughts more clearly, and possibly invite
		other people to consider the same issues, before I can rid myself of
		anxiety in this context.

		Last week, I felt I needed to start something different, before I got
		bogged down in that rather muted brown painting. I'm reasonably happy
		with it, but nevertheless, something needed to lighten in my life!
	      </p>

	      <p>
		So I restarted a very colourful work which I began a few months ago, but
		which had definitely got itself into a fix. There were far too many
		definite lines in there which divided up the space so much that the air
		had gone out of it. Nothing for it, but to paint some of them out. In
		doing so, a really interesting kind of texture in the paintwork is
		emerging. This is something a bit new, though I've noticed touches of it
		recently. Here are the two versions, with the older one above.

		It never fails to amaze me how each painting has an utterly different
		life. I don't think its necessarily apparent &#x2013; at least not on quick
		appraisal &#x2013; from looking at the final pictures. While from my point of
		view, they still look different when completed, other people seem to see
		them as part of a family, at least. The family resemblances might be
		seen as what other people call ‘style'. But just thinking about
		families, and considering talking about a family as having a ‘style'
		rather than similar looks, sounds so absurd. I'm equally flummoxed by
		the idea that my paintings are held together by style. Sometimes I don't
		feel that there's much that holds them together at all. But its not a
		good idea, I'm convinced, to try and force a painting into some kind of
		preconceived mould, some kind of ‘stylistic congruity' which will hold a
		group together (as a ‘body of work' &#x2013; another expression which confuses
		me).
	      </p>

	      <p>
		So, each one starts differently, and immediately takes off on its own

		original start that I made months ago:

	      <div id="org54d89be" class="figure">
		<p><img src="pics/blog/img_06041.jpg" alt="img_06041.jpg" />

	      <p>

		<p><img src="pics/blog/img_08801.jpg" alt="img_08801.jpg" />
		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		So where next? Looking at this early stage, I see all sorts of potential
		forms, but not a lot of overall structure. However, I don't want to lose
		the most interesting of those forms, so I will first try and strengthen
		them with some more tone (thin acrylic) and only after that I might
		change the overall structure by darkening larger areas, or even
		lightening them (both of which will suppress the forms within).
		Ultimately, it needs a lot of simplification, but if I go too hard on
		this at the start, I might miss out on a lot of potential.

		The first thing to do is to darken the whole painting a bit by putting
		on a thin layer of acrylic. I want this because otherwise, when I start
		drawing, or redrawing forms, the intensity of the tonal contrast when
		working over white or very light backgrounds has a negative effect. I
		prefer working on a neutral ground, where I can lighten or darken, and
		the process is gradual, rather than raw and immediate.

	      Its almost a month now, since I wrote anything here, and yet I've been
	      quite busy with painting. For some reason, I haven't felt like engaging
	      with this kind of reflection. I think its partly because I have found it
	      quite difficult to find my way through the last couple of paintings,
	      though I have made some progress. I am never quite sure if I should be
	      detailing in public all the struggling that goes on at times. Its not
	      that I'm ashamed of it; in fact I feel its a positive process. However,
	      in the thick of it, I really don't know what I'm doing, and its never
	      easy to admit that. Or rather, I might think I know what I'm doing for a
	      while, and then it becomes apparent that I didn't after all. Changes in
	      direction aren't easy to annotate. Mistakes, and wrong directions, are
	      critical, because that's when you learn something. But you don't know
	      the positive side of it til later. At the time, it doesn't feel that
	      good.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The large dark painting I started working over, and which I described in
	      my last post, has moved on quite a bit. Its still dark, and still has
	      quite a large, ominous presence. I've worked hard to build some space
	      into it, but I didn't want to take away all the sense of the thing,
	      which seemed like something I wanted to intensify rather than to
	      destroy.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      At a certain point, I started another one. This was also a used canvas,
	      but I painted it over with white, so that I could start afresh. Here are
	      some photos of how it has developed over the last week:

	      End of another week. Quite a lot happening in the studio, but some of it
	      (today, at least) on the computer.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I think I've more or less finished the first large painting that I have
	      been working on. This is how it stands now:

	    <p>
	      So I started another one; again working over an older piece that never
	      really gelled. Despite the fact that it didn't really work, I found
	      myself quite enjoying its density and, rather oppressive mood. Still, I
	      had to do something more with it, and I have begun doing just that.

	      This is what it used to look like:

	    <p>
	      But I turned it around, and started working it over with even MORE dark
	      paint!
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      So its a pretty dense mass of&#x2026; something:

	      Seriously back to painting this week. Facebook can wait awhile. By the
	      way, I've discovered that you can't look at the videos posted on FB from
	      vimeo on mobile devices. Should be fine on a PC, mac etc; but this is no
	      good, so I'm going to look into it (maybe use Youtube).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      As for the painting, I'm feeling quite optimistic. There is a vision
	      developing here. I just have to catch it, and work on it. I think I had
	      a similar vision back in the 1980s, and then at some point I moved on
	      and hardly even noticed. Now, looking back, something got lost, and I
	      want to recapture it. The only way I can get to it is through the
	      paintings of that time, but all I have is rather inadequate photographs
	      (predigital era).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img src="pics/blog/spearsandeyes.jpg" alt="spearsandeyes.jpg" /><br />
	      Spears and eyes 1986
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I think the vision came originally from my visit to Venice in 1982. Now,
	      I realise that an element of that vision derived from the settings of
	      the paintings in Venice in churches and palaces. Generally, a painting
	      there is surrounded by darkness. The luminosity of oil paint replaced
	      the luminence of stained glass windows in gothic churches and
	      cathedrals. This darkness is somehow metaphorical for that time, perhaps
	      reflecting the medieval period (the ‘dark' ages). And the paintings, the
	      light, the religeous subject matter, seemed like a way out of that
	      darkness.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      It wouldn't seem, on first sight, to be relevant to today's environment.
	      But I wonder. How did that kind of painting, in that kind of setting,
	      speak to me so powerfully? there is a darkness still (perhaps always
	      will be) even though the world seems outrageously and garishly overlit
	      with imagery. There is something missing at the centre of it all. And
	      I'm not talking about religeous stuff, just ‘something' that needs
	      exploring and to be made more explicit. What it might consist of remains
	      to be seen. Its a kind of exploration that is at the centre of what I'm
	      doing now with painting.

	      Another week and everything moves on at a breathtaking rate. I find it
	      hard to keep up with the changes. I want, instinctively, to SEE the
	      continuity in my work, but I have to be patient, because though I sense
	      that the continuity is there, when I look at the succession of work, it
	      is hard to see it directly. So I try and understand, because that may be
	      the only way not to get anxious. And yet understanding can be almost as
	      hard as seeing.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I am working with the ‘beginnings' of paintings again. Now, though, in
	      contrast to a year ago, I know that I am going to work things through
	      more, so the beginnings remain just that&#x2026; waiting for the next stage.
	      I have six small canvases to experiment on. To begin with, I have
	      started with acrylics, thinned heavily, which produce a rough
	      approximation to watercolour (without the extraordinary lush and subtle
	      effects that watercolour can produce). But in the second half of the
	      week, I began to wonder whether I would not be better off using oil
	      paints from the outset. With acrylics, the paint dries very quickly, so
	      edges form and thus forms emerge rapidly. With oil (thinned with turps),
	      it is possible to go over the first brushings with a rag, and soften
	      everything down. Edges disappear; the space gets more diffuse and
	      deeper. As an example of the acrylic approach, here is one small start:-

	      </p>
	    </div>

	    <p>
	      And here is a small canvas, started with oils. This painting is hard to
	      photograph, because it is so diffuse:-

	      Over the last few days, I've been working on a new painting which is
	      looking rather different from those images I put up on the 7th. I am
	      using a small number of colours, but those colours happen to be
	      primaries and very similar to the colours used in printing (cyan,
	      magenta, yellow and black). In printing, its possible with these colours
	      to represent almost any colour in the spectrum, but only when they are
	      used in a translucent fashion, when the light from the medium on which
	      they are placed (such as a white sheet of paper) bounces the light back
	      to the eye through a very thin film of ink. In some ways I'm replicating
	      this process with paint, using it thin (as I always do anyhow) and with
	      significant medium, so that its translucent. This is giving me much
	      brighter colour than I have had for a while, though I have used this
	      technique before. This is the painting:

	      weeks.

	      The first four are smaller studies, on board or paper:

	      The five images below are completed paintings, on a larger scale and on
	      canvas. Everything is finished in oil paint now. So different from last
	      year!

	      I'm am working steadily, but it doesn't seem the right time to be
	      commenting on the work I'm doing. I will do that later.

	      I have now split the blog into two parts. This bit, that you are
	      reading, is much shorter than the other part, and relates to this year
	      (2013) only. The rest is in part 1, which has a link to it at the top of
	      this page. This means that if you come looking for recent info, you
	      won't be burdened with downloading heaps of older images that you didn't
	      want to see anyway.

	      This week I started painting again.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I took a good look at the paintings I was doing in the last phase of
	      activity (from June to October 2012), and I wasn't particularly
	      impressed. The larger ones just don't quite gel. However, I managed to
	      pick three pictures that seem to represent what I am now thinking about
	      trying to achieve.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Here they are:
	    </p>

	      <img src="pics/blog/87.jpg" alt="87.jpg" />
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      There was another painting that I had left, not feeling quite sure
	      whether it could be considered finished. It was one that was virtually
	      unchanged from the initial free working with acrylics, so it fits (at
	      this stage) into the last lot of work I did for the Watters Gallery
	      show. However, looking at it with fresh eyes I can't imagine how I could
	      think that it might be finished. It is certainly not what I want to be
	      doing, and I decided to work it over completely. This seemed a good
	      place to start again. I mixed up some paints (five pots of colour quite
	      thinned down, and just a couple of extra colours on the palette) and got
	      started (that was yesterday). Here is the picture as I left it in
	      November:

	    <p>
	      and here is the central section that I have been working on for the last
	      couple of days:

	      Its hard to see the changes at this resolution, but I'm happy with the
	      way that the forms are becoming more defined (this is, of course, a
	      relative statement&#x2026;)

	      Its now 2013. I have taken a break from painting to complete some
	      much-needed renovations on our home.

	      But I keep thinking about my painting. Its quite helpful looking back at
	      this blog to remind me where I was when I stopped painting. I'm thinking
	      of redesigning the blog, breaking it up into smaller chunks. One very
	      long file has its attractions, but it means downloading EVERY picture,
	      every time you access it.
