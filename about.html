    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I am an artist/painter, born in the UK, living and working in Melbourne (Australia) since 1984.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to training in art school in London, I graduated as a doctor, and worked as a GP.
    </p>
    <p>
      I exhibited for many years at galleries in Melbourne (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinacotheca,_Melbourne">Pinacotheca Gallery</a>, Watson Place Gallery, Place Gallery), and in Sydney (<a href="https://wattersgallery.com">Watters Gallery</a>). As these galleries are no longer open, this website is now the main place where my work can be viewed.

	  Do not confuse me with another 'Rod McRae', who works in Sydney, and whose work is quite different (it often takes the form of installation with stuffed animals). This other Rod McRae has a different website (www.rodmcrae.com.au -note the '.au' at the end of his web-address), and often comes up in Google-type searches for 'rod mcrae'on the internet.
