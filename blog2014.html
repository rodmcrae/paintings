		I've got a little way to go in my efforts to prise myself away from
		making pictures. Or perhaps it doesn't matter that much in the end. The
		hard thing is getting started, and then the next hard thing is when you
		stop &#x2013; that's when the idea of whether this constitutes a ‘picture' or
		is just a mess emerges. At that point (which is where I am with the
		painting below, which I've been working on today), the best thing is to
		try not to assess it in any way. The decision whether to continue can be
		made without judgement, I think. I hope.

		I am thinking again about the idea of committing myself to doing
		something everyday, almost as a routine. However I don't want to try
		creating a new “picture” on each occasion. In fact I'm moving away from
		starting anything with the direct intention of creating pictures. It's
		almost as if I don't have the right to this activity. As if the genesis
		of picturehood is something which occurs outside of my direct control. I
		can engage in activities that may result in pictures but since the
		essence of a picture is something that exists in a space midway between
		the creator and the recipient, I can never control the transition from
		amorphous mess to meaningful image. Any picture that emerges is as much
		your creation as mine.

		I was up in Sydney last week for Watters Gallery's 50th anniversary. It
		was a wonderful event and confirmed everything that is unique about the
		place and its people.

		I had some good conversations about painting and what it means currently
		for me. One such conversation concerned the issue of structure and mess.
		I am quite interested in mess at the moment. I realise that my input
		into that conversation was rather particularly effected by my currently
		evolving ideas on this. I mentioned how the painting I'm working on
		reminds me of vertical gardens.
	      </p>


	      <div id="org8c1ffff" class="figure">

	      <p>
		I also think about the way that gardens evolve through the execution of
		natural laws governing the growth of plants &#x2013; and it is fascinating to
		observe how two plants set off across the garden and merge together,
		without any need for encouragement or intervention. I suppose that this
		is an aspect of how Darwin considered the development of a woodland bank
		which he wrote about in the last pages of the Origin of the Species.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		“It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many
		plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various
		insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,
		and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different
		from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner,
		have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in
		the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; inheritance which is
		almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct
		action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a
		Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a
		consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and
		the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature,
		from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of
		conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly
		follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several
		powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;
		and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed
		law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful
		and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”
	      </p>

	      <p>
		He was particularly concerned with the dominance of one species over
		another but when you look at what happens at the conjunction of one
		plant and another, this is not immediately apparent. The merging of the
		plants mimics the merging of areas of paint on the canvas but it is
		difficult to reproduce the sorts of rules (natural laws) that will
		determine the kind of merging that will happen. Once again,
		self-consciousness, and the rational mind, tend to get in the way.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		In the final year of my BA at St Martins in London, I became rather
		obsessed with the junctions between areas of paint in a very different
		way.
	      </p>


	      <div id="orgbe4eeea" class="figure">
		<p><img src="pics/blog/038.jpg" alt="038.jpg" />
		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		In that case I was wrestling with the line between two stained areas of
		(lightly sized) canvas, and how to make that line disappear as much as
		possible to maximise the effect the contrast between the painted areas.
		The structure of the painting itself was determined, like Darwins world,
		from the strict execution of rules set out before the painting was
		started. This produces some eccentric patterns which were never part of
		the plan. Taken further, this attitude to painting could represent a
		core that allows a lot of ‘natural' variation to occur, rather in the
		way that chaos theory can demonstrate.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		It is interesting to think about how introducing further rules of
		engagement in painting, as we tend to do all the time in practice,
		undermines the simple extrapolation of rules in this process. When I
		paint, there are so many elements and variables involved that its hard
		to see fundamental rules at work. But I think that they ARE there &#x2013; and
		can be seen in action on occasions. Perhaps the only relevance of this
		line of thinking is that it makes me keener to allow whatever seems to
		want to happen in a painting to occur. I need some kind of discipline to
		stop myself from imposing rules and ideas that seem to have worked in
		the past in order to let a new kind of structure in. Will it be an
		‘amorphous mess'? we shall see.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		When I try to picture an amorphous mess, I usually find myself thinking
		of the ‘primordial soup' which was the precursor to life on our planet.
		That all our varied forms of life emerged from this should tell us
		something, even if we are maybe not prepared to wait for a few million
		years for it to happen. We are SO impatient!

		and I'm seeing more and more relationships between the way that plants
		grow and occupy space, and my painting. The painting I'm working on
		right now (which has changed significantly since I was LAST working on
		it) reminds me of vertical gardens I saw in Paris. At least parts of it
		do. Obviously, the painting is bluer, perhaps suggesting a seascape but
		what interests me is the way the different plant areas interact and the
		flatness of the perspective.

		Looking for ways to expand on the drawing which forms the basis of my
		paintings. Though I am quite enjoying the softness of the recent
		paintings, I am also drawn(!) towards a certain surreal quality that
		comes naturally when the drawing is more arbitrary and confrontational.
		There is nothing more arbitrary than collage, and I am looking at how I
		have created drawings in the past using digital collage techniques. Its
		so long ago that I did this, that I've got to learn it all over again!

		I'm trying out transferring my website to WordPress, just adding it into
		this blog as extra pages. The pages will show as links at the top of the
		page. The first such page is Exhibitions, where I will be putting all
		the paintings from all the shows over the last 29 years. So far,
		however, only the last show is there! lots of work to do (but it is MUCH
		easier than editing the website in pure HTML).

		I decided to leave 365momentsinanymedium. I was beginning to find it
		intrusive having to produce a new complete work every day. Its not that
		the site or anyone else insisted on this regular output, but it was a
		personal commitment that I realised was becoming counter productive. I
		desperately need to work more on each piece than I can do in 24 hours.
		It has stimulated me into starting back into painting, but now its time
		to return to my own centre where I can paint long and hard on each work,
		which gives me such a wonderful opportunity to work out what it is
		about, and where I am going, as I go along.

		While I'm trying to keep up with the implied committment of the
		365momentsinanymedium to create something new every day, I'm not quite
		keeping up with it. Its good to have the incentive there &#x2013; knowing that
		when I DO create something, there is somewhere other than a pile on my
		desk to put it, and that someone else might actually SEE it.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		However, I'm keen to get down to something more substantial. At THIS
		moment in time, that is looking like it might be on the video side of
		things. I'm actually looking at collaborating with a musician (who
		happens to be my nephew) on putting some of the animations I have
		already done together with his electronic tracks. Having listened more
		deeply to his music, I think its quite an appropriate match. I'm also
		keen to do more, both on these videos (there are two that I'm thinking
		of &#x2013; one from the year 2000 and one from a couple of years ago) and
		also on new pieces. The more I look at this older work, the more I want
		to do something new.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I'll post something on here as soon as its finished (whenever that may
		be!).

		At last &#x2013; a little space from plastering walls and sanding floors! I am
		starting to get back into the world of painting again. One thing that
		has stimulated me has been reestablishing some connections with artists
		I knew way back in London in the seventies &#x2013; fellow students at St
		Martins. One of them, Gail Sagman, has set up a website called
		“365moments in any medium”
	      </p>

	      <p>
		(ed. not available any longer!)
	      </p>

	      <p>
		which I've joined. Its still small, though growing, and I'm using it to
		get myself back into the discipline of producing work regularly again.
		I'm not exactly clear whether there is an assumed committment to produce
		something every day (365 days a year), but &#x2013; hey, its not a bad idea!
		OK, so some work produced in that kind of way might be trivial, but at
		least it gets the process kick-started.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Now I've got to really think&#x2026;. and think fast (if I'm to get into this
		routine) what the work is going to be about.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		At the same time, and conjointly, I'm going to write some more on my
		website, in the ‘Story' section &#x2013;
	      </p>

	      <p>
		<i>NOTE! I have transferred the Story to this website (see menu above).</i>
	      </p>

	      <p>
		which has been languishing for a while now. I have just added some pages
		I wrote recently in there but in order to get it up to date, I have to
		start analysing the last show at Watters in Sept/Oct 2013. That is a
		good place to get back on the road to painting&#x2026;

		This is actually an older animation, made completely in Cinelerra, using
		masks in the compositor.<br />
		I'm working on the Blender angle, but don't have anything I really want
		to put up here yet. I keep being distracted by all the cool (and
		difficult!) aspects of Blender, such as applying images to objects. I'm
		a complete beginner, and there's quite a way to go. However, I've got

		This renovation business takes forever! But I am starting to think about
		other kinds of creativity again. Specifically, I'm looking at animation,
		using Cinelerra and Blender, which is pretty exciting. Haven't done any
		3D work for many years (not since I was a student, for a short while, in
		multimedia at RMIT around 2000). I will put some of my first &#x2013; very
		tenuous &#x2013; experimental clips up here later today.

		The show is well and truly over. Time to have a break, do some more
		renovation of the house, and eventually, to reflect on the work in the
		exhibition and decide where to go next. The momentum is temporarily lost
		&#x2013; need some time to work on it!
