	      Two paintings, and the link between them:

	    <ol class="org-ol">

	    </ol>


	    <div id="org8ee61a8" class="figure">
	      <p><img src="pics/artwork/TN/TNwolf-light.jpg" alt="TNwolf-light.jpg" />
	      </p>
	    </div>


	    <ol class="org-ol">
	      <li>Deluge felt before from 2013</li>
	    </ol>


	    <div id="org406a7c5" class="figure">
	      <p><img src="pics/artwork/TN/TNdeluge-felt-before.jpg" alt="TNdeluge-felt-before.jpg" />
	      </p>
	    </div>


	    <p>
	      The link between these works is not in their surface, texture or any particular technical attribute. 'Wolf-light' is painted very lightly in acrylic only, whereas 'Deluge felt before' was  worked up in oil paint to a much higher degree of finish. But to me they both encapsulate that previous concept that I wrote about of 'anticipation'. They are both frozen moments in time. You could say that all paintings have this character, to some extent, but some paintings seem to imply an event that has passed and is now complete, whereas these present a certain absence, the subject of which is a definite part of their meaning. What is absent is clearly not defined, just implied (if you read the cues).
