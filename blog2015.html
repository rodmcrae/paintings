		How time flies!
	      </p>

	      <p>
		This has been quite a difficult time for me. I have a feeling that I
		often react to having a show this way, but it does seem to be a bit more
		intense this time. I've thought about it a lot, and I can't quite see
		why it affects me so much, because deep down I really don't care that
		much about what goes on when the paintings get put up. And yet it does
		affect me, so I don't think I can dismiss it all glibly.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I think it is probably the simple fact of going public for a short while
		that is disturbing, rather than the kind of response (or lack of any
		response, which is more to the point, especially this time round), that
		the work generates. Those (mostly my friends and relatives) who saw the
		show at the opening seemed responsive enough, but after that it was
		apparently a very quiet affair &#x2013; with very few people tramping round
		the gallery. All of this is really not very important, but I find that I
		can't work easily after the show is over, and have lost the connection
		with the work which I had leading up to it.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Gradually, I'm getting back into painting again, but its a slow process.
		I've stopped doing the Generative Art course &#x2013; it required much too
		much time and involvement at this stage, and I think would have been a
		distraction to my return to painting.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		This is a small work I've started recently:

		and I have started a couple of works on masonite, which I haven't
		painted on for years, and I find the surface quite interesting:

		The show is up at Watters Gallery, and I'm happy with the way it looks.
		The opening was fun &#x2013; thanks to everyone who turned up (lots of
		relatives in Sydney, and old friends), specially Tony and Betsy who
		drove all the way from Maldon in Victoria to see the show.

		Now its time to move on!

		I've just signed up to a free course run by Monash University, on behalf
		of Futurelearn, which is an initiative of Open University UK. Its called
		Creative coding and it is about learning to code in a creative way to
		create&#x2026;. well, creations! Its directed towards artistic production
		rather than practical, but the principles can be applied to a lot of
		different functions. They use a system called Processing, which I was
		not aware of before, but should have been, as its a fairly unique
		project based in Boston, UCLA and NYC. The IDE is built on Java and is
		all open source and &#x2026;.. free! its surprisingly easy to use and get
		into graphic development.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Here's my first insignificant project &#x2013; writing my name using a very
		simple codebase, which has been personally adapted (this is how the
		learning happens&#x2026;)
	      </p>

	      <p>
		What is most interesting to me is that the theory around the production
		of artwork in this way is very reminiscent of the kind of thinking
		behind the systems work I was doing back at St Martins in 1975-6, well
		before computers became widely available. They call this stuff
		Generative Art (though I'm not sure what kind of art isn't generative).
		I don't really like the indirectness of the process, as compared to
		painting (its more like printing in that sense), but it certainly throws
		up unpredictable results, and the range of images produced by the
		(thousands, it seems) of students doing this course is quite amazing.

		My show at Watters approaches. The opening is next wednesday, and I will
		be driving up to Sydney with Barbara on Saturday with a cargo of
		paintings in the back of the car, ready for hanging on Sunday.

		I've been very remiss in the last couple of months at writing anything
		on this blog. And now, I am beginning to feel a real need to write more
		in my ‘Story' section of this site, because the substance and appearance
		of my work continues to evolve, and I think I need to reflect on where
		its heading. I thought I would write something before the show, but now
		it feels like the wrong time to do that. The work is paramount, not the
		reflection on it. That can come later. If you can see the paintings on
		the walls of Watters Gallery, all the better.

		Another painting started. The first stages were rather tentative and the
		result delicate:

		I felt in some danger of trapping myself with a drawing which wasn't
		going to be easy to change. That would be fine if I was sure that the
		drawing was what I wanted, but I wasn't. The landscape feel that this
		drawing had seems to keep finding its way into my paintings but I don't
		think it's quite where I want to be right now. So my choice was to paint
		it over with white and start over, or to forge ahead and work over this
		painting with new marks and a new feeling. I decided on the second
		option and this is what happened:

	      <p>
		The landscape has gone and there are just a lot of marks, not even forms
		yet. This looked a lot more open. After a few hours work it looks like
		this:
