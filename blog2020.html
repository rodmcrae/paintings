		I dug out the plaster of paris and came up with this form:

		I had already made a few smaller things in wood filler, which I
		subsequently painted black. All these small forms start to interact.

		Perhaps this is leading somewhere. Certainly its stimulating my

		I have been continuing to work over the last four months, but this blog
		has lapsed. Rather than trying to fill the gaps, I'm going to start back
		with what I'm doing currently. This is what interests me enough to want
		to write about it.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		In painting, I am trying to work with simple forms, which lets me
		experiment with their articulation in space. This has always been
		central to my work.

	      <p>
		I've mostly skirted around the edge of figuration in the past. Perhaps
		this is about to change.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I'm also going back to some sculptural work, using various media to
		build forms. This will feed back into the painting.

		These small paintings on canvas are all in an indeterminate state, ie.
		possibly unfinished.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		They seem to be moving in quite different directions. But I am enjoying
		the variety. When the time comes to focus more on one kind of painting,
		then I might start working larger again.

		This one has been frustrating me recently. Its something to do with the
		way the forms get locked in and I feel quite constrained with the

		I've wondered whether I should stop maintaining this blog, since I am
		still unsure of its purpose. But when I look back to earlier posts, it
		helps me to understand what I was concerned about at the time I wrote
		them.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Yes, I keep a personal painting diary, but the flavour of it is always a
		bit different from these public posts. I can't exactly explain how, but
		to me it feels generally more concise - which I imagine arises out of
		the subtle difference that I will put this out on the internet, whether
		anyone reads it or not.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Its a little bit like the difference between paintings that I've put in
		exhibitions (the public face of my art) and all the others that never
		get seen by anyone else. The odd thing is that these posts show exactly
		those works, which don't get out into the public. And since I don't have
		an intention (at present) to show work in exhibitions again, this
		becomes the central focus of my work. Or at least its documentation and
		at least some exposure to external scrutiny.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Connecting back to the last post from 2019, I started back on that
		lightly worked ink drawing using charcoal (which had been my initial
		intent). So it currently looks like this:
