		With the break, I'm putting a few more images on the New work page (NB
		this refers to my Wordpress site). And then its time for a short break.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I've been trying some more collage, and pre-collage (where I just
		arrange bits and pieces and then photograph them, without resolving the
		issues by sticking things down).
	      </p>

	      <p>
		And I'm thinking about constructivist issues, both rough analogue stuff
		and more hard-edged and rectilinear motifs.

		I find it quite hard to analyse what I'm doing at the moment, so I won't
		really try. Instead, I want to keep pumping out images, which I have
		been doing to an extent, and then I will put them up here, where others
		can see them, from time to time. Even this is quite difficult for me,
		because I have a tendency to try and only show work that fits into some
		kind of pattern. This work is fairly chaotic at the moment, but that's
		also the joy of it for me. I don't know where its heading, but as long
		as its heading somewhere (which it seems to be) &#x2013; that's OK.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I'm working with unfamiliar materials such as newspaper, core-flute,
		tissue-paper and packaging of various kinds. Its quite a change from oil
		paint on canvas, and is very refreshing to me. I might introduce such
		things as oil paint at some stage, but I'm also keen on expanding the
		digital reproduction into projections and video. Photography is
		currently a key concern, since it takes me inside of the works, changing
		my (and hopefully your) perspective. Some of the ambiguity that comes
		from these photos is exactly what keeps me interested, and wanting to do
		more.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		There are more recent images on my New work page (see my Wordpress
		site).

	      <p>
		This will be somewhere I can paste images of my new work without
		comment. You will have to make of it what you will. A lot of this work
		currently is experimental and, dare I say it, casual, in that its not
		made particularly for consumption, rather for the sake of the process of
		making it, which is becoming more and more my main aim. So its a rag-tag
		mixture of themes and styles and materials which doesn't really make a
		lot of sense, yet. Maybe never will. We shall see.

		I've added two new pages to this site, Tablet drawings (mainly done on
		an iPad I bought a little while ago), and Notebook drawings. (see my
		Wordpress site).
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Just collecting together some of the studio work I've been doing
		recently, which is all moving forward steadily, while not exactly
		translating into larger scale paintings at the moment. Both using ink on
		paper, and using the screen on the tablet, seems more intuitive to me
		just now, so I'm going to run with this a while longer. I also want to
		create another new page with older drawings on it; coming soon! Links to
		the new pages are here and in the main menu.

		Haven't posted anything for a while now. But I've been working on
		drawings in ink on paper, which I am now trying to scale up to canvas
		(with mixed success). I'm pretty happy with the ink drawings, and will
		try and put some more up here to bring everything up to date.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		In the meantime, I've also started mixing some of the images in GIMP.
		These are fairly simple mixes so far, with no further working of
		details. In general, this process produces more complex images, and I'm
		not completely sure that this is the direction I want to go in. But I
		love the process, and I love the surprises that it throws up, and it can
		be incredibly quick, so I think I will persist. It really jogs my
		senses.

		Here, I have painted on masonite with black acrylic, managing to pull
		off some of the effects of ink on paper:

	      <p>
		and here, I have started up a reasonable sized canvas in a similar
		fashion (but I think this requires more work):

		I bought an iPad. Strange, yes. Haven't had anything Apple for many
		years. But I wanted to be able to sketch on a device, and it was feeling
		a bit cramped on my phone. And it does have a nice screen. I think it's
		going to be quite interesting.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		There is a surprising depth to the kind off marks you can make.
		Sometimes it feels like working with a hard pencil, or even etching.
		Sometimes it's almost like flowing ink onto paper. This business has
		come on so much since I first started drawing on a computer fifteen or
		twenty years ago.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Inevitably, I will try out quite a lot of styles before I really find my
		feet. Here are a few sketches to start with&#x2026;

		Worked on drawings in notebooks (ink). Feeling good!
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Here are some:

	      <p>
		<img src="pics/blog/001.jpg" alt="001.jpg" /> <img src="pics/blog/002.jpg" alt="002.jpg" />
		<img src="pics/blog/003.jpg" alt="003.jpg" /> <img src="pics/blog/004.jpg" alt="004.jpg" />

	      </p>

	      <p>
		Then I took one of these (the first one after the first whole page
		view), and I tried drawing it up onto one of my medium large canvases:
	      </p>


	      <div id="orgbe758ac" class="figure">
		<p><img src="pics/blog/011.jpg" alt="011.jpg" />
		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		filled in the shapes with straight (thinned) black acrylic:
	      </p>


	      <div id="org50777d2" class="figure">
		<p><img src="pics/blog/012.jpg" alt="012.jpg" />
		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		and gradually increased the black, specially at the edges (also fixed up
		the white area with primer):
	      </p>

	      <p>
		<img src="pics/blog/013.jpg" alt="013.jpg" /> <img src="pics/blog/014.jpg" alt="014.jpg" />
		<img src="pics/blog/015.jpg" alt="015.jpg" />
	      </p>

	      <p>
		It still doesn't look quite like the ink on paper, of course, but I can
		work on this any way I want. But fundamentally, I want to get away from
		the intense concentration on the paintwork, the surface and the finish,
		and focus more on the drawing &#x2013; what the shapes mean, can represent or
		suggest. Got a lot more work to do at a basic drawing level &#x2013; using the
		ink in my notebooks is great, but I should also do some one-off drawings
		(stretch up some paper) too.
