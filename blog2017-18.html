		One of the advantages of not putting stuff up on this site <i>too</i>
		frequently is that when I come to review the images of what I have done
		recently, I can start to see what is more or less interesting. That's
		frequently not the case on a day to day basis.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		While I'm still doing 2 dimensional work on small boards and canvases,
		such as the image below

		I've also restarted working with newspaper stiffened with acrylic and
		painted, more or less, with black paint (acrylic). Sometimes, the
		photography of these things, by distorting the context and scale, opens
		up new possibilities for me.

	      <p>
		Other times, the situation of the object when I photograph it also
		expands possibilities

		This means starting off my blog again, and finishing off a new page for

		My last show at Watters is approaching. Its the last show because
		Watters is sadly closing down at the end of 2018. I will be having a
		survey show in the ground-floor part of the gallery, and showing recent
		work upstairs. Its been a bit of a challenge for me, mainly fathoming
		out how to show the recent work in the way that best fits it. The last
		few months have been a time of process and experimentation, so I want to
		get across some of that dynamic element to the work. However, a gallery
		is a gallery (as opposed to a studio) and its not necessarily the
		appropriate environment for expressing continuous change and experiment.
		I have a lot of work to put in, which is in itself challenging, but
		also, not all of the work is so extremely dynamic and experimental.
		Everything needs to have the appropriate attention and pulling it all
		together isn't easy.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I will certainly include some of the slightly strange objects that have
		emerged recently. Whether to present them sitting on a flat surface
		(which is how I have had them in my studio over the past months)
	      </p>

		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		or to hang them on a wall, scattered in such a way as to draw attention
		to the space of the wall and the interaction between the pieces (which
		is a much more difficult thing to achieve) is still an open question for
		me.
	      </p>

		</p>
	      </div>

	      <p>
		I will probably end up doing some of each of the above. I want to keep
		in mind that this is just the beginning of a phase of work which could
		end up going in various directions. Only by working more (and this is
		not really the time to be doing that) will I work out properly which
		directions are more interesting.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		One thing that has come out of this process, is that I'm returning to my
		website and finishing off some of the parts that need it. I haven't
		posted anything in this blog for a while, and over the past few months
		its been sporadic. So here I am&#x2026; engaging once again.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I want to create a new page that includes images of most of the work
		that will be in the show. It will be provisional, because some decisions
		are made only at the time of hanging.

		I've made some changes to the website, splitting up the Shows page,
		because it was taking too long to load the images. Hopefully, this won't
		be too obvious, and I think it now works better.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		In the studio, I've mostly been working on framing some of the ink
		drawings. I'm also thinking about the presentation of the many small
		objects I have made over the last year or so. Putting them together
		creates a whole new set of potential resonance and meanings. How they
		end up is almost not the point at all. It is the manipulation of them
		and what happens along the way (more like a little adventure than a
		finished product). This is why photography is so important for me just
		now, because I can capture moments where the things just set each other
		off in interesting ways.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Thinking this through leads to an idea that I could create little dramas
		that would be embodied in digital stories rather than physical
		constructions. However the physicality of these objects (however roughly
		made) is still quite engaging, so I won't stop working with actual,
		physical materials yet.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Lastly, I've closed down my Facebook page. It is all part of a grand
		plan to divorce myself, as much is possible, from the tentacles of the
		huge and ominous tech companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) which
		I truly believe are threatening both our privacy, culture and politics
		in unprecedented ways. More on this later &#x2026;

		Just realised that I hadn't uploaded the pictures for this page of the
		blog. Which makes it pretty dull (and mostly meaningless). So I've put
		that right.<br />
		I have also put on the videos where the links were missing.

		This website is now public! (which is probably why you are here)<br />
		AND I have transferred my domain name to point here too, ie.
		www.rodmcrae.com, or <a href="http://rodmcrae.com">http://rodmcrae.com</a> (or just rodmcrae.com in your
		browser header) will get you here.<br />
		The biggest task remaining for me to transfer everything over from
		Wordpress is to complete the archives of my blog, which go back to 2008.
		Since this won't be of much interest to most people, I will complete it
		without rushing.

	      <p>
		I also need to update the "Story" page, which lags current work by
		several years.<br />
		That's a much bigger task, since it involves assessing exactly what the
		work has been about!

		First blog entry on my brand new website (so brand new that its not even
		public yet).<br />
		Despite having a virus which is reducing all my energy for painting, I
		worked in the studio today and, for my trouble, produced this rather
		strange piece of work:

		There is a lot of work to do to transfer older posts that I've written,
		both on my own website and on Wordpress. But I don't see that as a
		reason to neglect to write new posts as I gradually get all the old
		stuff online.

		Working simultaneously on some quite varied subject matter. In the ink
		drawings over glossy white acrylic, there are definite moves towards
		figuration. Meanwhile, the painted structures (here, using various
		discarded packaging) are more ambiguous. The bits of original material
		(cardboard, clear acrylic plastic) lend a ready-made or constructivist
		feel. The marks are tantamount to graffiti.
