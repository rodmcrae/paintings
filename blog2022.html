		While it is always useful to work on new directions using smaller works as experimental groundwork, sometimes something else is required. I&rsquo;m feeling a need to work on larger paintings and to gradually assemble a small but coherent group of them to present a more convincing body of work (and ideas). I haven&rsquo;t done this for quite a while now. The last show I had (<a href="2018.html">Watters 2018</a>), consisted of multiple themes including a survey of work covering the last thirty years or so, new work that I would roughly describe as &ldquo;Romantic Dada&rdquo;, many recent small drawings and paintings, plus two or three medium sized paintings. This did not really consitute a coherent body of work. On the contrary, I felt like I was still very much exploring new potentials.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Its time for a change. I intend to start working on this new body of work right now. And to start me off, I will rework some older paintings that never quite satisfied me. The first of these is one that I put in that Watters show mentioned above, called &ldquo;Dancing backwards in time&rdquo; Here it is as it was in that show:

	      <p>
		Today, my first task was to slow down some of that frenetic movement in the painting, by toning back a large part of it (using thinned black paint). The result was more interesting than I expected:

		Returning to this one after a bit of a break, I find myself totally embroiled in the issues of how to proceed in a fog. I like fogs, as it happens, and this is inhibiting to progress in this case. I have to simply bite the bullet and attempt to make something new out of the previous stage, since in some serious ways it does not satisfy me. Its hard to see at the scale of these photos, but I think I&rsquo;m making progress.

		I&rsquo;ve started a new section called Extext, which you can access from the
		home page (or <a href="extext/extext001.html">here</a>). This is an attempt
		to bring what I have been doing on the new blog (mentioned in the last
		post) back into the fold of this, my main, website. Its very small right
		now (just four pages) but its easy to maintain and add to, so I will!
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I have deliberately made it look a bit different from the other pages as
		its all about trying to create something new, and out of context (thus
		the name &rsquo;Extext&rsquo;). Sometimes all the history of my painting can become
		burdensome to me, and I feel restricted in how to move forward.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		This is my attempt to do that, in a way that uses the medium of this web
		business a bit more effectively.

		I saw a program on TV recently where a Tasmanian man has a craft

		different product from using one of the many automated systems, such as
		Wordpress. Its the difference that is interesting, not that one way of
		doing things is the <i>right</i> way.

		I&rsquo;ve moved this website to a new host - Github Pages. I liked Fastmail
		as a webhost, but it was always just a bit too slow, since the servers
		are over in New York (I believe), and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any
		locally cached sources for people to access it directly over on this
		side of the world. Github looks like a good alternative. To my mind, it
		seems very fast now, and I know that Github has servers all over the
		world. I also like the way its set up, even though it has taken me a bit
		of time to get to grips with the git system of version control, which is
		behind everything done there. Since git grew out of a linux base
		(developed by Linus Torvalds), it all feels pretty familiar to me. We&rsquo;ll
		see how we go. I am still keeping my email at fastmail, so I can always
		switch back if it doesn&rsquo;t work out.

		In itself, de-shopifying might not change what I do, here in the studio,

	      <p>
		As artists, we all like to think that how we work is not really
		determined by financial concerns. Or even by the idea that someone else
		might OWN the piece that we are working on. We would like to think that
		this is insignificant to the way that we approach the work&rsquo;s
		development. I wonder if this is entirely true though. I find myself
		wondering in some subtle ways how the work will be viewed by others, and
		this makes me potentially self-conscious, and could well affect the way
		that I work.

	      <p>
		Its not a big jump to the suggestion that taking out any financial

		Now that this website is not clearly linked to the process of selling
		work, I hope that I can explore this new &rsquo;freedom&rsquo; and I shall be

		I have decided to remove the shop pages from my website. This is part of
		a big rethink of what I am trying to achieve, and where to go from here.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		When I decided to add those pages, about this time last year, the main
		objective for me was to make new connections with people who, I hoped,
		might like to own work and thereby connect more directly with what I am
		doing in my painting world. It was never about making money out of the
		work. When people were directed to my site at this time, they showed
		great interest, for which I was (and remain) extremely grateful. It was
		a period of some joy for me, knowing that people were actually looking
		closely at the paintings, albeit in photographs and not in real space
		(as might occur in an exhibition). That they might seriously consider
		paying real money for those paintings was gratifying.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		However, it was just a moment, in the long continuum which is our lives!
		After I while, I realised that the interest would not continue unless I
		vigorously pursued it. We all have so much going on in our lives that we
		move on at a rapid pace, and our attention is diverted elsewhere. I also
		realised that I don&rsquo;t have much interest in actively approaching people,
		though email, messaging or networking, in order to tempt them towards
		acquiring works of art. So I left the shop pages in case anyone was
		still interested, for several months, and then decided that not much
		further activity was likely to occur without further interventions of my
		own (which I wasn&rsquo;t inclined to follow up). It was time to move on, and
		try another approach. The first stage of that process was to remove the
		pages, and references to them, from the website. I&rsquo;ve now done that.
